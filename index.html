    <p id="introduction" class="fadeIn">
      Hi! I'm Aryan, a 14-year-old developer with a deep passion for
      technology and an ambitious goal of becoming a skilled web
      developer. Ever since I first discovered how websites come to
      life behind the scenes, I've been captivated by the magic of
      coding. It‚Äôs amazing how a few lines of HTML or a clever
      snippet of JavaScript can build something interactive and
      exciting. That sense of possibility is what fuels me.
    </p>

    <p id="extrainf1" class="fadeIn">
      So far, I‚Äôve explored a variety of programming languages‚ÄîHTML
      and CSS for front-end design, JavaScript for dynamic features,
      Python for logic and automation, and even C# for more
      structured, object-oriented projects. I enjoy challenging
      myself by building things from scratch and figuring out how to
      improve them step by step. Whether I‚Äôm experimenting with
      layouts, solving bugs, or learning new frameworks, I take
      each opportunity as a chance to grow.
    </p>

    <p id="extrainf2" class="fadeIn">
      But it‚Äôs not just about the code for me. I‚Äôm fascinated by how
      design meets functionality. I want to build user-friendly
      experiences that make people‚Äôs lives easier, more enjoyable,
      or even a bit more fun. One day, I hope to contribute to the
      web in a way that‚Äôs meaningful‚Äîmaybe by creating my own apps
      or helping others bring their ideas online.
    </p>

    <p id="extrainf3" class="fadeIn">
      I know I‚Äôm still at the beginning of my journey, but I‚Äôve got
      the energy, curiosity, and commitment to go far. Every day I
      try to learn something new, improve my skills, and connect
      with developers who inspire me.
    </p>

    <p id="finalLine" class="fadeIn">
      Thanks for stopping by‚Äîand if you're a fellow coder, creator,
      or someone curious about tech, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.
      Let's build something awesome. üåê
